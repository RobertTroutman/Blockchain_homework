# Blockchain_homework

## Summary:

 In this homework we were asked to set up a custom testnet blockchain for our employer at ZBank, who had interest in the possibilities of what blockchain technologies could do for the company and customers together.

 I have provided step-by-step instructions on how to setup this custom network for ZBank and demonstrated a test transaction between two differemt test accounts.


 ## Instructions:

Before we get started you should decide which command tool you would be most comfortable with using, `Anaconda Prompt` or `Git Bash`, both can be used. I myself chose `Git Bash`.

* To start this project we will make sure we are in our directory that has our "Go Ethereum Tools". There we will setup our genesis by runnning the command `./puppeth`, followed by naming your network.
